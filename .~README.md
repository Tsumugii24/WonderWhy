```bash
$ conda create -n wonderwhy python==3.10 # wonderwhy is the name of your environment
$ conda activate wonderwhy
```

&emsp;&emsp;2. Install essential `requirements` by run the following command in the `CLI` 😊

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

&emsp;&emsp;1. open `.env.example` and fill your own `API Keys` in the **corresponding place** if you want to use certain LLM, then **rename** the file into `.env`

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = ""
OPENAI_URL_BASE = ""
```
